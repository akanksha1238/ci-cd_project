## Overview

**Project Description:**
PURPOSE :
The project involves the creation of a CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, with integration with GitHub, SonarQube, and Docker. 
The primary purpose of the project is to automate the software development and delivery processes, enhancing efficiency, reliability, and code quality.

KEY FEATURES :
Continuous Integration (CI): Developers can push code changes to the GitHub repository, and Jenkins automatically triggers the CI/CD pipeline. 
This ensures that code changes are quickly integrated and tested.
Continuous Delivery (CD): The pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application.
Docker is utilized for containerization, ensuring consistency across different environments.
Code Quality Analysis: SonarQube is integrated into the pipeline to perform static code analysis.
It identifies and highlights issues such as bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells, promoting the maintenance of high-quality code.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS EC2:**
  In the project, AWS EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) plays a vital role in providing scalable and on-demand virtual machines for various stages of the CI/CD pipeline.
   Specifically, EC2 instances are used to host and execute certain components of the pipeline, such as the Jenkins server, build agents, or deployment servers.

- **Jenkins:**
In our CI/CD pipeline project, Jenkins serves as the central automation server, orchestrating the entire software development life cycle. Its key roles include:

Code Integration: Jenkins monitors the GitHub repository for code changes.
Upon detecting new commits, it automatically triggers the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring rapid integration of code changes.
Build and Compile: Jenkins is responsible for building the application from the source code. 
It compiles the code, resolves dependencies, and creates executable artifacts.
Automated Testing: Jenkins facilitates automated testing by running unit tests, integration tests, and any other specified testing suites. 
It provides feedback on the code quality and identifies potential issues early in the development process.
**Used Plugins:**
GitHub Integration: Use the "GitHub Integration" or "GitHub Webhook" plugin to trigger the CI/CD pipeline on code changes pushed to the GitHub repository.

Docker Plugin: Integrate the "Docker" plugin to build and push Docker images. This allows Jenkins to work seamlessly with Docker for containerization.

SonarQube Scanner Plugin: Configure the SonarQube Scanner plugin to perform static code analysis. This plugin sends code analysis results to the SonarQube server.

AWS Credentials Plugin: If deploying to AWS, use the "AWS Credentials" plugin to securely manage and use AWS credentials for interaction with AWS services.

- **GitHub:**
  1. Source Code Repository:
Central Code Repository: GitHub serves as the central repository for the project, hosting the source code and related assets. 
while working on project we used to collaborate and contribute to the codebase through pull requests.
2. Webhooks and Automated Triggers:
Webhooks Integration: GitHub webhooks are set up to notify Jenkins of any changes to the repository.
This triggers the CI/CD pipeline automatically whenever there are new commits, ensuring continuous integration.
- **SonarQube:**
 SonarQube is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to perform static code analysis.
 The primary purpose is to assess and ensure the quality of the codebase by identifying and highlighting issues such as bugs, security vulnerabilities, and code smells.
 Code Analysis Process:
Static Code Analysis: SonarQube conducts static code analysis, examining the source code without executing it.
This process identifies potential issues by analyzing the code structure, syntax, and patterns.
Language Support: SonarQube supports a wide range of programming languages, making it versatile for projects with multi-language codebases.
Integration with Jenkins: The Jenkins pipeline is configured to trigger SonarQube analysis as a dedicated stage.
The pipeline sends the codebase to SonarQube, which then performs the analysis and provides feedback.

## Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline
Jenkins CI/CD pipeline is a key element in modern software development, enabling automation of the software delivery process.
Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD):

**CI Phase:**

**Code Repository Integration:**
The Jenkins CI/CD pipeline starts with integration with a version control system, commonly Git (GitHub in this case). Jenkins monitors the repository for changes.
**Automated Builds:**
Upon detecting changes, Jenkins initiates the build process. This involves fetching the latest source code, compiling it, and generating artifacts.
Jenkins uses build tools like Maven or Gradle based on project requirements.
**Unit Testing:**
After the build, Jenkins executes unit tests to ensure that individual components of the application function as expected. This phase helps catch errors early in the development process.
**Code Quality Analysis:**
Jenkins integrates with tools like SonarQube to perform static code analysis, identifying code smells, bugs, and security vulnerabilities.
Artifact Archiving: The resulting artifacts from the build are archived for later use in deployment stages.

**CD Phase:**

**Deployment to Staging:**
Jenkins deploys the application to a staging environment for additional testing. This environment closely resembles the production environment.
**Automated Testing (Integration and Acceptance):** 
The pipeline runs integration tests to verify the correct functioning of the integrated system. Acceptance tests may also be conducted to ensure that the application meets business requirements.
**Deployment to Production:**
After successful testing in the staging environment, Jenkins deploys the application to the production environment. This stage may involve blue-green deployments or canary releases for minimizing user impact.
**Rollback Mechanism:**
A rollback mechanism is in place to revert to the previous version in case issues arise post-deployment.
